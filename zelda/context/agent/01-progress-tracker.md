**Project:** zelda-nes — *The Legend of Zelda (NES)* as native TypeScript in the
browser.
**Working dir for all commands:** `zelda-nes-ts/`

**Last updated:** 2026-08-11 · **Phase:** C (Rendering) complete · **Slices done:** 14 / 45

## ⚠ Read this before planning anything

This is a **reimplementation from reference**, not a port or emulator. You read
6502 assembly (the disassembly) and TypeScript/C#/JS (the reference repos) and
write TypeScript by hand. Nothing is transpiled; nothing is emulated.

**Next action: slice D1** — Link movement: 4-direction, 16×16 hitbox, tile
collision, screen-edge detection.

**Phase A gate:** blank canvas renders at a stable 60 fps, `npm run typecheck` and
`npm test` clean, sprites load from `public/assets/`.

## Open questions for the user

Answer cheaply, unblock later work. **None of these block A1.**

1. **Asset gaps.** If a reference repo lacks a sprite we need, should we extract
   from another repo, create manually, or defer?
2. **Second Quest priority.** Currently the last slice (L2). Move it earlier?
3. **Music source.** Reference repos have some OGG/MP3 tracks. Sufficient?

---

## Notes worth carrying

- **The disassembly is the behavioral authority.** The reference repos are all
  incomplete (5–35%) and may have bugs. Use them for patterns, not behavior.
- **Data-driven design.** All map data, enemy tables, item tables in JSON. This is
  what makes Second Quest a data swap, not a code fork.
- **Canvas 2D, not WebGL2.** The NES game has no shader effects. Canvas 2D with
  `image-rendering: pixelated` gives pixel-perfect nearest-neighbor scaling.
- **Reference repos surveyed** (2026-08-02): aldonunez (100%), bobbylight
  (15–20%), hfiggs (30–35%), humbertodias (15%), Matthew-SA (10–15%),
  jdr81394 (5–10%).

## Session log

Newest first. Keep entries to one short paragraph. Archive to `../PROGRESS.md`
once this passes ~10 entries.

### 2026-08-11 — C4 Screen transition (Claude Opus 4.6)

Created `src/world/screen-transition.ts` — ScreenTransition class managing
push-scroll animation between overworld screens. NES-accurate timing from
Z_05.asm ScrollWorld: horizontal = 4px/frame × 64 frames (256px), vertical =
4px/frame × 44 frames (176px). Stores direction, old/new screen references,
and offset. getOldScreenOffset/getNewScreenOffset return per-direction translate
values: Right=(-offset,0)/(256-offset,0), Left=(+offset,0)/(-256+offset,0),
Down=(0,-offset)/(0,176-offset), Up=(0,+offset)/(0,-176+offset). Updated
main.ts: replaced instant screen swap with animated transition. Arrow key
triggers startTransition() which saves old screen, computes new screen coords
(with wrapping), creates ScreenTransition. During transition: update advances
offset, input is blocked, Link walk-animates. Render uses ctx.save/clip/
translate/restore to draw both screens at their offsets within a clip rect
(prevents tiles from drawing over HUD during vertical scroll). Link is drawn
on the new screen at its offset. On completion: transition cleared, Link
position reset to center. Exported isHorizontal() helper. 23 new tests
(391 total). Typecheck clean. Visually verified: horizontal scroll shows both
screens sliding with correct offset, HUD stays fixed, transition completes to
new screen. **Phase C complete. Next: D1.**

### 2026-08-11 — C3 HUD / status bar (Claude Opus 4.6)

Created 3 new files in `src/ui/`: `hud.ts` (HudRenderer class + HudState
interface + formatCount), `bitmap-font.ts` (BitmapFont class wrapping SpriteSheet
for the 9×7 cell font.png, charToIndex mapping matching ZeldaJS), `heart-meter.ts`
(HeartMeter class + computeHearts with NES-faithful half-heart granularity from
Z_01.asm FormatHeartsInTextBuf). HUD draws hud.png background at (0,0), then
overlays dynamic values: hearts at (176,40) with 8px step and 2-row support for
16 max containers, rupee/key/bomb counters at NES PPU nametable positions
(96,24)/(96,40)/(96,48) using "X23"/"123" format, overworld minimap green dot
(3×3, #83d313) at x=17+col*4, y=24+row*4 matching NES UpdatePlayerPositionMarker.
Magic key support ("XA" display). Updated main.ts: replaced placeholder orange
HUD bar with HudRenderer initialized from assets (hud.png, font.png,
treasures-full.png), passes static HudState with 3 hearts and minimap tracking
screenRow/screenCol. Bug fix during session: font cell size was 9×7 not 8×8
(discovered from ZeldaJS LoadingState: `addSpriteSheet('font', ..., 9, 7, 0, 0)`).
37 new tests (368 total). Typecheck clean. Visually verified: HUD background,
hearts, counters, minimap dot movement, Link sprite + tiles unaffected.
**Next: C4.**
