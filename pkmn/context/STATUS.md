## ⚠ Read this before planning anything

**The code from the July–August sessions was lost** (found 2026-09-22; DECISIONS
#26). Those sessions worked on a modified copy of the engine — 30 maps, ROM gate
removed, `static/` + PNGs, Psychic fix, 49 SFX — and **no copy of it exists
anywhere**. `game/` is a fresh copy of **vanilla upstream**. What those sessions
*learned* survives in `ARCHITECTURE.md` / `CONVENTIONS.md` / `DECISIONS.md`, so
rebuilding is cheaper than the first time. The rebuild is **Phase V**.

If a context file claims "30 maps", "395 tests", "the gate was deleted (P5-2)"
or "PSYCHIC chart implemented" without a *lost* marker, it is stale — trust this
file and the code, and fix the stale line.

**Commit policy (user, 2026-09-22):** commit **locally** at the end of every
slice — `git add` + `git commit` from the root, message ending with the
co-author line. **Never push** — there is no remote and there must never be one
(Hard rule #9, DECISIONS #24).

---

## Current phase

**Phase R is done** (2026-09-22). **Phase V** rebuilds the lost 30-map state (V1 ✅ → V2 ✅ → V3 Gym + Museum → V4
Diglett's Cave + Route 3 → V5 fixes), with Phase A slices in between (DECISIONS #29, #35, #55). **Now: A5c–A5f** (note 65,
#70): A5d ✅ and **A5c ✅ complete**: A5c1, A5c2 and A5c3a–f. A5c3f is the switch-over (note 72); the game has run on the new battle
engine since its 09b, and the user's play-test passed on 2026-11-01. Two small slices followed on 2026-11-02: the
timing tests (#90, note 73) and the overworld RNG (#91, note 74). **A5e is now in progress:** checkpoint-01's trace
is complete; checkpoint-02, checkpoint-03a and checkpoint-03b were independently accepted on2026-11-03
(notes75–77). **R-SYNC complete (note78, Codex): pret names synchronized, ROM6019/6019 restored.** Next checkpoint-04's planning,
then the remaining A5e work, A5f (the wild catch), and V3. Earlier detail is in `HISTORY.md`.

## 📍 Where things stand — updated 2026-11-03 (*Setup* not reinstalled today; refs pulled 2026-11-03 evening, see the `refs/` row)

### Setup — done

| Item | State |
|---|---|
| Git | Root repo, branch `master`, **no remote**. Baseline commit `9bf2d7d` = docs + vanilla upstream. `.gitattributes`: text LF, `*.png`/`*.tilemap`/`*.gbc` binary. `game/.gitattributes` (the user's, tracked since 2026-10-14, DECISIONS #53) repeats those rules for `game/` and adds linguist hints |
| Committed generated files | `game/data/` (196 JSON) + `game/static/` (525 PNG, 3 tilemaps, 196 JSON); R-SYNC setup2026-11-03 changed only the two text-program JSON files by one key, with identical ops. Regenerate, never hand-edit |
| Ignored | `*.gbc`/`*.gb` (the ROM), `refs/`, `pkmn-sprites/`, `node_modules/`, `dist/` |
| `game/LICENSE` | **Removed by the user (2026-09-22): "i want it gone".** Deletion committed with R1c. Don't restore it (DECISIONS #28) |
| ROM | `game/pokeyellow.gbc`, SHA1 `cc7d0326…4a38e1` (DECISIONS #14) — re-verified 2026-09-22 |
| `refs/` | All 5 on pinned branches, refreshed **2026-11-03** with `./pull-refs.sh`: `pokeyellow` master `b452f2ab` (was `e89ead15`, +45: pret named every remaining symbol; ROM unchanged; **R-SYNC complete: 63-name mapping applied; historical readers adapted per note78 section6.1**), `gen1recomp` dev `d85a6176` (was `20ab97ab`, +480), `oldamber` main `268d571` (unchanged), `engine` main `1986dd93` (was `79957401`, +21: Gen 1 `calc.zig`/`chance.zig` and build), `dmg` main `5e3b785` (unchanged). `file:line` citations written before note 78 refer to `e89ead15` |
| `game/` | `gididaf/pokemon-yellow-typescript` `main` @ `05faa114` (2026-03-27), no `.git/`. Upstream `game/CLAUDE.md` folded into root `CLAUDE.md` → *Engine reference*, then deleted; moved on to `context/ARCHITECTURE.md` and the subsystem docs 2026-10-06 (DECISIONS #42) |
| `npm run setup` | 196 JSON → `data/`; static 525 PNG + 3 tilemaps + 196 JSON mirror (A5c3f checkpoint-08g adds `monster_names.json`, note 72 §10.18; setup twice, only the two new name-table files). A5c3e checkpoint-02: setup twice byte-identical across 909 files; three new SFX assets, old bogus flute music removed, four text keys added; all 901 other surviving files unchanged (note 71 §10.2.4) |
| Typecheck | Clean |
| Tests | **R-SYNC checked by Codex,2026-11-03: ROM6019/6019; no-ROM5762 pass /257 skip**, default workers, each first resumed run after note78 §6.1. Typecheck/build clean; both mutation witnesses caught and restored byte-for-byte. Bundle **`index-bMM8kWJs.js`**,655,183 bytes; SHA256 `17adc69aa12392c395bb72b54d13f62d0f116cbd33efa60335580c719de3bf31`. Initial baseline6015/6019 and the authorized historical-reader stop are recorded in note78 §7 |

### What the game has today (upstream audited 2026-09-22, plus every slice since)

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Runtime data path | ✅ **No ROM** (R1b): the browser loads only `static/` via plain `fetch()` / `<img>`. Upstream's upload gate is deleted; the bundle has no gate code |
| Vite | `publicDir: 'static'`, `base: '/'`, `appType: 'mpa'` (missing file = real 404). Tab title **PKMN** |
| Background tabs | ✅ keeps running unfocused — logic + music (worker ticker, DECISIONS #27). User-verified |
| Maps | **12 playable**: PalletTown, RedsHouse1F/2F, BluesHouse, OaksLab, Route1, Route22, ViridianCity, ViridianPokecenter, ViridianMart, ViridianSchoolHouse, ViridianNicknameHouse. **+7 playable through the debug warps since V1b:** Route2, Route2Gate, Route2TradeHouse, DiglettsCaveRoute2, ViridianForest, ViridianForestSouthGate/NorthGate, with music, palette and Pikachu. **Since V1e the walking path is open:** Viridian → Route 2 → the Forest, once the old man's demo is done. **+5 since V2a:** PewterCity, PewterPokecenter, PewterMart, PewterNidoranHouse, PewterSpeechHouse, reached from Route 2's north edge (24 maps). The Museum and Gym doors fail gracefully until V3; the east road waits for V4 |
| Warps | ✅ since V1b: the player keeps their facing through warps, as in the ASM; Pikachu appears where Yellow's spawn states put it (`pikachu/pikachu_spawn.ts`) |
| Demo gates | ✅ **Gone since V1e**: the invented Viridian text and Route 22's fake Blue. A test fails if "demo" appears anywhere in `data/game_text.json` or `data/maps/*.json` |
| Viridian old men | ✅ **since V1e, as `scripts/ViridianCity.asm` runs them** (`story/viridian_city.ts`): the sleeping man's push-back; the forced demo after the Pokédex (fails, walk-away, Pikachu steps aside); the Mart spawning the walking old man and his repeatable demo (caught); the locked Gym door (hop down the ledge). The city's `wViridianCityCurScript` is saved (`mapScripts`), which keeps the Gym-door quirk (DECISIONS #34). User-verified |
| Route 22 | no NPCs (the rivals are I1). Its gate door leads to the unextracted `Route22Gate` and fails gracefully |
| Wild data | 57 `wild/*.json` |
| Music | **46** tracks extract; A5c3e checkpoint-02 removes the invalid `pokefluteinbattle` music entry (the real streams are unused SFX data) |
| SFX | **21** preloaded, including A5c2 CP2's RUN (bank `$08`, header `$41c5`, ID `$97`; no playback caller yet), the nurse's `healing_machine` and intro animation's preloaded `shrink`. Wired: `press_ab`, `collision`, `start_menu`, `go_inside`/`go_outside`, the two field-medicine sounds, the machine, and shrink. A5c3f checkpoint-02 adds four unused files (`damage`, `not_very_effective`, `super_effective`, `trainer_appeared`); 31 SFX JSON files, 10 unused. Other SFX and bank-aware lookup → V5 |
| Type chart | **PSYCHIC bug present** — chart uses `PSYCHIC_TYPE` on both sides, species use `PSYCHIC`, so Bug→Psychic 2×, Fighting→Psychic ½×, Psychic→Psychic ½×, Ghost→Psychic 0× never apply (DECISIONS #10) → V5 |
| Hidden items | ✅ **A1b, user-verified; A5b4 timing reviewed and user-verified:** DisplayTextID opens, found program begins at T+20 before give, flag on success, longer jingle and full map close; cartridge full-bag waits. Forest Potion/Antidote and Viridian City Potion |
| Item balls | ✅ **A1b, user-verified; A5b4 timing reviewed and user-verified:** extracted `item` selects `PickUpItem`; box opens at T, give/hide T+20, found program T+23, `get_item1`, full map close after sound and A's release. Saved `hiddenObjects` keeps balls gone and tiles free. Full-bag failure keeps the ball. Route 1's sample preserves the flag-first quirk. Trade kid (A4) and Oak's Aide (A2) still await their handlers |
| Trainers | ✅ **since V1c, as `home/trainers.asm` runs them**: before-battle text → meet music (male / female / evil) → battle; on a win the fanfare after the last Pokémon, "defeated", the pic scrolling back in, "CLASS: " + end text, money; beaten only after a win (saved); after-battle text when talked to again. Oak's Lab rival: his texts, no blackout on a loss, `rivalStarter` saved. Since A5d every entry runs the shared transitions (user-verified 2026-10-18) |
| Trainer sight | ✅ **A1c, user-verified 2026-10-06** (`notes/20-a1c-plan.md`, DECISIONS #43): the Forest's map script runs `TrainerEngage` on standing passes ($fc quirk, pop-in), the meet music at spotting, EmotionBubble (61 frames), the `MoveSprite` walk-up, `wJoyIgnore`/`BIT_SEEN_BY_TRAINER`, `EndTrainerBattle`'s pass. Forest sight ranges 4, 4, 1, 0, 4. The hop-midpoint `RunMapScript` → V4 (tripwire test) |
| Catch demo | ✅ **since V1d**: Oak's Pikachu catch runs the ASM's simulated FIGHT → ITEM → POKé BALL input, with both outcomes (caught, or 3 shakes and "Shoot! It was so close too!"). Since V1e the Viridian old man uses it too |
| Whiteout | ✅ `handleBlackoutWarp` — halves money, heals, warps to last Pokécenter |
| Badge stat boosts | ✅ `battle_loaders.ts` `applyBadgeStatBoosts` (the cartridge's, on the battle copy). Nothing awards a badge yet → V3 |
| Battles | ✅ **The new engine since A5c3f 09b** (notes66–72): byte-backed turn/effects/items/AI/end; old engine deleted.10c already wired growth, starter Pikachu entrance, retreat and slide-offs. Remaining presentation: the live silhouette intro (unused03b replacement accepted, awaiting04 integration), poof/OAM, substitute/minimize/transform and other named cues; move animations stay OFF (#83, O-50 open); catch screens/demo retirement stay A5f. Last user battle play-test2026-11-01; no new live intro to play-test today |
| Random numbers | ✅ **The cartridge's `Random` / `BattleRandom` everywhere** (note 74): one page-lifetime owner of `hRandomAdd` / `hRandomSub`, VBlank's per-frame call outside battle, each site's carry. No production `Math.random` (a census pins it). Battle frames skip the VBlank call (backlogged) |
| TM/HM teaching | ❌ → A2 |
| Poison walking, Repel, Escape Rope | ❌ (items exist in the price table only) → A3 |
| Text and menus | ✅ **A5a/A5b**: every overworld text, sign, hidden event, bookshelf, story scene and menu text runs the cartridge's text programs with its timing (printer, DisplayTextID open/close, PrintText); the Mart, bag, field medicine, HP bar, item/Pokécenter/Bill's PCs, START and SAVE are the cartridge's. Battle text runs on the cartridge's programs too, since A5c3f. The StatusScreen port (stats pages, shared party opening, corrected medicine timing) is user-verified |
| Evolution, move learning, Pokédex, PC, shops, save | ✅ (see `ARCHITECTURE.md` → *Engine reference* and `game/src/battle/ARCHITECTURE.md`) |
| Save | `localStorage` key `p151-s` — use **`http://127.0.0.1:5173/`** |
| Overworld pace | ✅ **since A6a (2026-09-28): the ASM's 2-frame pass.** Player and Pikachu 16 frames a step (measured 15.99), NPCs 34 (Yellow's fast codes 18, walking in step with the player 16), the mirrored up/down walking frame, the turn rule, the ledge jump table, the joypad read on standing passes, held-key triggers fixed (`overworld/walk_pace.ts`, DECISIONS #36). The user: "he walks at a perfect, gb speed". **Every cutscene, a ledge, NPC/Pikachu pace and START across a step user-verified 2026-10-01** |
| Overworld behavior | ✅ **A6b** the order inside a pass, pop-in, hiding under UI, encounter gates (2026-10-01). ✅ **A6c** NPCs wander and turn by Yellow's movement bytes with pixel sprite collisions, beaten trainers turn, Pikachu idles, glances and does its antics (2026-10-04). ✅ **A6d** the ledge shadow, the landing pass, and Pikachu on Yellow's follow-command buffer (2026-10-04). ✅ **A6e** Pikachu's scripted moves run Yellow's own interpreter — the step-aside, the nurse, Oak's Lab, the emotion preludes (2026-10-05). All user-verified |
| Sim FPS | ✅ **Game Boy rate, 59.7275 Hz** since 2026-09-25 (DECISIONS #33, `core/tick_clock.ts`), holding that rate at any display refresh. `-` / `+` step through multiples of 5 (10–200) with the Game Boy rate as a stop between 55 and 60 |

### Controls (upstream)

| Action | Keys |
|---|---|
| D-pad | Arrows or WASD |
| A / B | X / Z (swapped from upstream's Z / X at the user's request, DECISIONS #71) |
| Start / Select | Enter / Shift |
| Unlock audio | Click once on "Click to start" |
| Pause | `p` |
| Debug overlay + warps | Backtick (warps: Pallet, Viridian, Route 1, Route 22, Lab, houses, Pokécenter, Mart; since V1b also Route 2 south and north, the Forest, both Forest gates, Route 2 Gate, the trade house, and the Diglett's Cave entrance). Its **Skip Intro** button sets the intro flags and adds a Lv5 Pikachu, which is enough to test Pikachu following |
| Sim FPS | `-` / `+` (the Game Boy rate is the stop between 55 and 60) |

### Scope freezes (user)

- **1:1 vanilla Yellow.** No rebalancing, no improvements, no added content. Gen 1
  bugs reproduced deliberately.
- **Sprites are vanilla Yellow from ROM extraction** for the whole build.
  `pkmn-sprites/` stays untouched.
- **Randomizer = year-two idea** (X1, dead last, DECISIONS #21–#23). Don't start it,
  don't design around it.
- **Local only, never pushed** (DECISIONS #24). Saves on `127.0.0.1`.
- **Timeline: 1–2 years, ~700–800 sessions.** Milestones, not sittings. A session
  that delivers one small verified thing is a good session.

CP1–CP4 by Sol, reviewed by Claude, **user-verified 2026-10-16**; note 59, DECISIONS #50/#63 |
| **Map-music fade-out** ✅ | `PlayDefaultMusicFadeOutCurrent` for warps, connections, battle returns, the blackout and CONTINUE; the shared PlaySound state; the Pallet/Lab "follow me" theme; the warp waits for the door sound. CP1–CP4 by Codex/Sonnet, checked by Claude, **user-verified 2026-10-18**; note 63, DECISIONS #67/#68 |
| **A5d** ✅ | All 8 battle transitions and the cartridge's 3-bit choice, the dungeon lists, the prologue and OAM clear (the source sprite survives), the flash on BGP only, `PlayBattleMusic`'s one-frame gap, the tail, black held until the battle is ready; every battle start routed through it. CP1 Sonnet, CP2–CP4 Codex, CP5 Codex + Sonnet, each checked by Claude, **user-verified 2026-10-18**; note 65, DECISIONS #70 |
| **A5c1** ✅ | Battle foundations, unused until A5c3: 360 battle text programs extracted (633 → 993) with op-and-address bindings; `BattleScreen` and its pure renderer (32 × 32 BG, the CGB attribute map, 8 OBJ palettes, `SET_PAL_BATTLE`'s 2 held + 3 frames); the HUD writers and `UpdateHPBar` both ways; the low-health alarm on its own pulse-1 voice. CP1 Codex, CP2 Codex + Grok, CP3–CP5 Grok, each checked by Claude (2026-10-19); note 66, DECISIONS #72 |
| **A5c2** ✅ | The battle's menus, unused until A5c3: `DisplayBattleMenu` (normal, Safari, the catch demos' simulated input), the bag on `DisplayListMenuID`, RUN with `SFX_RUN`, the party hand-off (SWITCH/STATS/CANCEL), `MoveSelectionMenu` (all three types, SELECT swap); `TileSurface` shared with the field menus. CP1–CP5 Codex, each checked by Claude (2026-10-19); note 67, DECISIONS #74 |
| **A5c3a** ✅ | The battle's state and plumbing, unused until A5c3f: the text runner's battle features, `BattleState` (one cell per WRAM address, A5c2's contexts as views), the loaders, the stat routines, the math ports and `BattleRandom`, the program host. Checkpoints 01–05, Grok and Codex, each checked by Claude (2026-10-20); note 68 §11.13 |
| **A5c3b** ✅ | The turn, unused: `MainInBattleLoop`, `SelectEnemyMove`, both `ExecuteMove` programs, the status checks, disobedience, the damage, hit and crit routines from the ASM (#77), residual damage. Checkpoints 01–07, Codex and Grok, each checked by Claude (2026-10-20); note 68 §11.34 |

| **A5c3f** ✅ | The switch-over: the live game on the new battle engine (09b), the user's play-test (passed 2026-11-01 after 10c–10f), then the old engine retired (11a–11f: RUN on `BattleRandom`, manifests, 7,651 lines deleted, carries, test helpers). Codex, Grok and Codex, each checked by Claude (2026-11-02); note 72, DECISIONS #83–#89 |
| **Timing tests** ✅ | One 30 s suite timeout, no per-test overrides (a guard pins it), the 1 ms render case best-of-10; the re-run-alone rule retired. Codex, checked by Claude (2026-11-02); note 73, DECISIONS #90 |

Sonnet implemented; Codex independently checked. Notes75–77,35 new cases; **A5e itself remains open** |
| **Intro animation** ✅ | Oak's speech frame for frame: BGP/OBP0 palette fades (the silhouette, the white fades), the window slide, the tile slides with the BG-thirds tear, the 7-frame pic copies and the shrink wipe, little Red, `SFX_SHRINK`, the intro music's fade-to-stop, the 20-frame entry and 40-frame white exit. CP1–CP5 by Codex, checked by Claude, **user-verified 2026-10-18**; note 64, DECISIONS #51/#69 |

## In progress

**R-SYNC complete, Codex,2026-11-03 (note78 §7).** Ref `b452f2ab` and the expected red baseline confirmed;
141 replacements in50 files, two generated one-key renames, then exactly the four historical-reader shims
authorized by §6.1. Exactly8 old-name occurrences remain, all in those shims. Resumed gates pass first run:
ROM6019/6019, no-ROM5762/257, typecheck/build; both mutations caught and restored byte-for-byte.
Row0 removed. Next: Codex plans/spikes/briefs checkpoint-04; no checkpoint-04 work started.

**Session stopped at the user's request on 2026-11-03. No active implementation.** The accepted stop point is
checkpoint-03b; do not rerun it or begin checkpoint-04 from a roadmap row. **Codex plans/spikes/reviews; Sonnet
implements after a concrete brief** (DECISIONS #93). The user may change roles later.

**A5e checkpoint-03b reviewed and accepted** (`notes/77-a5e-checkpoint-03b-brief.md` §9, Codex,2026-11-03).
Reviewed both Sonnet commits (`6dc2536` code/logs, `3c201d9` docs): matches the spike, no correctness/scope
findings and no code fix. No runtime consumer reaches the new modules. Independent gates: ROM6019/6019,
no-ROM5762/257, typecheck/build/marker clean, unchanged bundle/hash;19 plain mutation witnesses including
an omitted hSCY reset. **Next: Codex plans/spikes/briefs checkpoint-04; it is not started or briefed.**
**Its live phase/capture/audio/text binding and timing/DIV audit are unbriefed; fixture phase counts are not
cartridge ISR timing measurements.** The new Program must not run through the unchanged BattleHost.

**Restart list for checkpoint-04:**

1. Read root CLAUDE → this handoff → note75 §2/§4 (inventory/sequence), note76 §7 (renderer support),
   note77 §2–§3/§9 (source trace, driver contract, accepted limits), and the battle architecture's A5e section.
2. Read the relevant ASM and inspect `battle_init.ts`'s interim slide, `BattleHost`, `battle_session.ts`, and
   main's tick/render/audio ownership before designing the integration.
3. Trace live entry phase, capture partial rasters before latches, distinguish masked-LCD versus palette-held
   audio, compose real text and audit frame-driven DIV/ledgers before permitting expectation changes.
4. Spike and write checkpoint-04's own brief (next note number **79**; 78 is the rename sync).
   No checkpoint-04 spike or executable brief exists yet. Sonnet implements only after this planning step.

Note75 §4 gives the later checkpoint sequence; checkpoint-03b is accepted in note77 §9. Existing growth,
Pikachu entrance, retreat and slide bodies already work (A5c3f10c); do not re-port them from stale cue prose.
**O-50 pending:** Codex asked whether attack move animations stay separate. No unambiguous selection yet;
intro planning remains independent. Resolve before the poof-data/animation-routing brief. The screen-model merge
still waits until after A5e. Catch animations/demo retirement stay A5f; battle VBlank RNG stays backlogged.

**Current A5e workflow (user assignment,2026-11-03):** Codex traces/spikes a checkpoint, captures its whole diff,
restores the tree and briefs stops, exact counts and plain mutation witnesses. Sonnet applies/audits it, runs
ordered gates, reports and commits locally. Codex independently re-runs gates and adds a mutation. Stop at
each review; visible live changes later need the user's play-test. Earlier Claude/Codex assignments are historical.

**Rules learned in A5c3f's checkpoint 11 (note 72):**
- census rows go only when the source text they record is deleted (§11.89);
- snapshots may only lose subtrees named after deleted things (§11.85);
- a `keep` case reading dead code is replaced by a new-engine test (§11.88).

**Since note 73: one 30 s suite timeout and no re-run-alone fallback.** A timeout in a full run is a real failure.

The finished A5c3f / timing / RNG detail moved to `HISTORY.md` → *Archived STATUS sections (moved 2026-11-02)*.

## Next up — queue

Claim the top one, finish it, verify, **commit locally**, log it, stop. Full roadmap in `PLAN.md`.

| # | Slice | Phase | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **A5e** intros and animations | A | **03b checked; Codex next traces/spikes/briefs04.**04 is unbriefed. Parent scope note65 §4 (#70); animation scope O-50 pending. Then **A5f**, the wild catch's animations and catch demo integration |
| 2 | **V3** Pewter Gym + Museum | V | Brock → BADGE_1; Museum 1F/2F |
| 3 | **V4** Diglett's Cave + Route 3 | V | Also `RunMapScript` at the hop midpoint (#43; `trainer_tripwires.test.ts` fails first) |
| 4 | **V5** Recovered fixes | V | PSYCHIC chart, SFX catch-up and bank-aware lookup, species display names, the map-object audit incl. hidden-event facing (note 19 N-2), **the CGB palette-command hold** (2 held frames before each `SET_PAL_*`'s Delay3; DECISIONS #73) |

After that: **the opening and title screen** (DECISIONS #69: copyright, Game Freak star, Yellow's intro movie, the title
animation and Pikachu's PCM clips; backlog entry in note 57), then **the battle-mechanics audit** (#70), then A2, A3, A4
(in-game trades, plus the player ID and the older-save question, #59), then Phase B.
Before planning any of these, search `notes/57-findings-backlog.md` for the slice id.

### Slice notes (for whoever claims them)

- **Driving the game from browser automation:** synthetic key taps shorter than
  one read are lost, because `input.ts` polls key *state*: once per tick (16.7 ms)
  in menus and text, and since A6a once per standing pass (33.5 ms) in the overworld. Hold each key ~100 ms (keydown → wait → keyup via
  `window.dispatchEvent`, `e.key` names: `x` = A, `z` = B (since DECISIONS #71; harnesses in `notes/` before 2026-10-18's swap used `z` = A), `Enter` = Start, arrows).
  Walking one step = ~160 ms held. More from V1b:
  - Start a temporary server with `npx vite --host 127.0.0.1 --port <spare>
    --strictPort`. Plain `npx vite` binds `localhost`, which is IPv6 `::1` here, so
    `127.0.0.1` URLs time out.
  - The splash needs a real click, then about a second before the title shows.
  - Debug overlay: backtick, then Skip Intro (Pikachu), then the warp dropdown + Warp.
  - The debug panel shows `Map … step x,y … dir:`, which is handy to read back with
    JS.
  - The first step after any warp skips the warp check (`justWarped`). A debug warp
    next to a door needs one step away and back.
  - A text box with `cont` lines needs one A press per scroll.
  - From V1c: a `javascript_exec` call times out after **45 s**, so keep each walk or
    button loop short. A stray A press that opens a text box makes every walk loop
    stall. The tab can turn `hidden`: rAF stops, and the debug panel stops
    rebuilding until the tab is visible again.
  - To stage a story state, edit the save in `localStorage` (`p151-s`: `mapName`,
    `playerX/Y` in px = step × 16, `eventFlags`, `party`) and CONTINUE. That's how
    V1c reached the lab rival. Use a spare port (V1c used 5179), so test saves never
    touch the user's 5173 origin, and clear them afterwards.
  - Music changes show up as `performance.getEntriesByType('resource')` entries
    under `/audio/music/`, one per track per page load.
  - From V2a CP4: arrow keys are `ArrowUp`/`ArrowDown`/…; text boxes close with **B** (A re-talks); after `NEW GAME` →
    "Skip intro? YES" the party is **empty** (the debug panel may still show a stale lead — type a species + `+ Add`); the panel
    lags about a second; the game only advances while a script runs in the page; don't press `-`/`=`; don't poll `getImageData`
    every frame. Details: `notes/60-v2-plan.md` §16.
- **Browser automation:** the game's A button is **X** and B is **Z** (DECISIONS #71, 2026-10-18; before that it was
  the other way round). Say so when handing over for a play-test.
- Notes for finished slices (R1, V1's reusable patterns, A6, A1) are in `HISTORY.md` → *Archived STATUS sections (moved
  2026-10-24)*; each slice's own plan in `notes/` has the detail.

## Open questions

- **O-50 pending (2026-11-03):** keep attack move animations on the existing OFF path in a separate future slice,
  or include them in A5e? Codex recommends separate (note75 §1). Asked; no unambiguous choice yet. Independent
  intro work is independent; resolve before the animation-data/routing brief.
- **O-49 ✅ answered 2026-11-02 → DECISIONS #91:** yes. The overworld RNG slice ran before A5e (note 74).
- **O-48 ✅ answered 2026-10-30 → DECISIONS #86:** option A. After a battle, an un-nicknamed mon's name goes back as
  upstream's `species.name`; 09's write-back implements it.
- **O-47 ✅ answered 2026-10-30 → DECISIONS #85:** the battle's species names come from the cartridge's `MonsterNames`, in
  checkpoint-08g before 09 (Claude briefs it next session).
- **O-46 ✅ answered 2026-11-02 → DECISIONS #90:** yes. A small separate slice for the load-sensitive timing tests runs
  after A5c3f, before A5e. It landed as note 73, and §11.16's re-run-alone rule is retired.
- **O-2: Crystal animated GIFs in the randomizer pool?** Not blocking; decide when
  X1 starts. (`DECISIONS.md` → *Open*.)

Resolved questions (O-5 … O-29; O-30 … O-38 since; O-42 … O-45 on 2026-11-02) moved to `HISTORY.md` → *Archived STATUS sections* on 2026-10-16; each
outcome is a numbered entry in `DECISIONS.md`.

## Notes for later

Findings that each have a future home moved verbatim to **`notes/57-findings-backlog.md`** on 2026-10-16.
**When you plan a slice, search that file for its id** (`V2`, `V5`, `J2`, `A5c`, `E1`, …). Most
entries point at V5 or J2; a few at A5c–A5f, V3, V4, I1 and E1. New findings go there too.

- Cable club receptionist (`ViridianPokecenter:4`): link features need a user decision; no slice is invented for it.

## Session log

### 2026-11-03 (R-SYNC complete after the authorized historical-reader shims) — Codex

- Confirmed ref/baseline; applied141 replacements in50 files and regenerated only two one-key JSON changes. Stopped correctly on four historical-reader failures; resumed with exactly note78 §6.1's four shims. Fixed the stop-entry encoding; frozen history/pin unchanged.
- All resumed gates pass first run/default workers: old-name count8 in the four shims, typecheck, ROM6019/6019, no-ROM5762/257, build. Both mutation witnesses fail as required and restore byte-for-byte. Bundle655,183 bytes; full hash/report in note78 §7.
- Row0 removed; one local slice commit, never pushed. Next is checkpoint-04 planning, still unstarted/unbriefed; O-50 remains open. Logs in `%TEMP%/pkmn-rsync-*.log`; no later checkpoint work.

### 2026-11-03 (refs pulled; pret rename sync planned) — Claude (Opus)

Ran `./pull-refs.sh` at the user's request: pokeyellow +45 (pret named every symbol), gen1recomp +480, engine +21. Full ROM
suite after the pull: **6015/6019**, with 4 `text_programs.test.ts` failures on the renamed `PartyMenuText_12cc`. Scoped every old pret
name our files cite (63 symbols: 141 uses in `game/`, more in notes) and wrote `notes/78-pret-rename-plan.md` as Codex's
executable brief, queued as row 0. No code changed. Checkpoint-04's brief moves to note 79.

### 2026-11-03 (day wrap: all context refreshed; stopped after03b) — Codex

- Updated all seven project context files, root entry point and battle/render docs. Consolidated today's checkpoints, roles, commits, current baseline and04 restart list; archived older STATUS entries and the stale PROJECT state verbatim to HISTORY.
- Final checked state remains note77 §9: ROM6019/6019, no-ROM5762/257, unchanged655166-byte bundle/hash.02/03a/03b accepted; no active implementation,04 unstarted/unbriefed, O-50 open. No runtime/test/data changes or additional test run in this documentation-only wrap.
- User ended the day. Next session: Codex plans04, then Sonnet implements its reviewed brief. Local docs commit, never pushed.

### 2026-11-03 (A5e checkpoint-03b checked and accepted) — Codex

- Independently reviewed both Sonnet commits (`6dc2536`+`3c201d9`) against the source, spec and retained patch. No correctness/scope findings or code fixes. Documented the two-commit process deviation; no runtime import or old test/data/snapshot changes.
- All18 prescribed mutants and an independent omitted hSCY reset fail plain assertions and restore byte-for-byte. Ordered gates pass first time/default workers: typecheck/build/marker, ROM6019/6019, no-ROM5762/257; bundle/hash unchanged. Evidence note77 §9 and `review-*`.
- Accepted only the unused Program/phase contract. Next:04 needs its own real-driver/phase/capture/audio/text trace, spike and brief; not started. O-50 open. Baselines refreshed; oldest entries archived verbatim. Review committed locally, never pushed.

### 2026-11-03 (A5e checkpoint-03b implemented; awaiting Codex review) — Claude Sonnet

- Applied note77's `spike.diff` (SHA256 `4c660457…24cb3`); the three source hashes match. Audited the Program against `core.asm:9–132` (LCD-off staging, 72 iterations from B=$70/C=$90 with split writes at LY64/96, 21 shadow head X −2, hSCX after, tail, HideSprites Y-only) and the §3 timing contract.
- Eighteen mutations each caught by an AssertionError; both sources restored byte-for-byte. Ordered gates pass first time, default workers: typecheck, build, 09c marker, ROM 6019/6019 (238 files), no-ROM 5762 pass/257 skip. Bundle `index-D4Ol9Anq.js` 655,166 bytes, hash unchanged. Logs `notes/77-a5e-checkpoint-03b/sonnet-*`.
- No departures. Two local commits (code+logs, then docs), never pushed. Checkpoint-04 and live wiring not started. O-50 open.

### 2026-11-03 (A5e checkpoint-03b spiked and briefed) — Codex

- Note77 briefs the complete unused silhouette Program and phase-aware raster/capture contract. The LCD wait is zero/one boundary by entry LY; the final raster freezes its upper96 rows before the window opens. Real session/phase/audio/text integration remains04; no live timing approval is inferred from the fixture model.
- Spike:21 cases,18 plain mutation witnesses with byte-for-byte restoration. Ordered gates pass first time/default workers: typecheck/build/marker, ROM6019/6019, no-ROM5762/257; bundle/hash unchanged. Captured patch/logs, removed game files and checked applicability. No implementation landed; baseline remains5998.
- Next: Sonnet implements only note77 and stops for Codex review.04 unbriefed; O-50 open. Oldest entries archived verbatim to HISTORY to keep the live log short. Planning committed locally, never pushed.

### 2026-11-03 (A5e checkpoint-03a checked and accepted) — Codex

- Reviewed `67e14ee` independently against the source, spec and retained spike: no correctness/scope findings; no game changes needed. No live caller enables the field; existing tests/snapshots/data unchanged.
- All seven prescribed mutants and an independent early body-end mutation fail plain assertions and restore byte-for-byte. Ordered gates pass first time/default workers: typecheck/build/marker, ROM5998/5998, no-ROM5741/257; bundle655166 bytes/hash exactly as briefed. Evidence note76 §7 and `review-*`.
- Refreshed checked baseline references, including CLAUDE (no pending user edit), and archived oldest STATUS entries verbatim. Next:03b needs its own trace/spike/brief; not started. O-50 remains open. Local review commit, never pushed.
