**Project:** pkmn — Pokemon Yellow playable in the browser, zero ROM dependency.
**Working dir for all commands:** `game/`

**Last updated:** 2026-11-10 · **Phase:** V (Rebuild the lost work), with Phase A slices in between · **Milestones done:** 8 / 36 (R1 ✅, V1 ✅, A6 ✅, A1 ✅, V2 ✅, A5 ✅, V3 ✅, V4 ✅); **V4 closed after user play-tests; V5 planning next**

## ⚠ Read this before planning anything

**The code from the July–August sessions was lost** (found 2026-09-22; DECISIONS
#26). Those sessions worked on a modified copy of the engine — 30 maps, ROM gate
removed, `static/` + PNGs, Psychic fix, 49 SFX — and **no copy of it exists
anywhere**. `game/` is a fresh copy of **vanilla upstream**. What those sessions
*learned* survives in `ARCHITECTURE.md` / `CONVENTIONS.md` / `DECISIONS.md`, so
rebuilding is cheaper than the first time. The rebuild is **Phase V**.

If a context file claims "30 maps", "395 tests", "the gate was deleted (P5-2)"
or "PSYCHIC chart implemented" without a *lost* marker, it is stale — trust this
file and the code, and fix the stale line. V4 checkpoint-02 wires all 30 extracted maps
at runtime. The rebuilt cave and Route 3 passed the user's play-tests on 2026-11-10.

**Commit policy (user, 2026-09-22):** commit **locally** at the end of every
slice — `git add` + `git commit` from the root, message ending with the
co-author line. **Never push** — there is no remote and there must never be one
(Hard rule #9, DECISIONS #24).

---

## Current phase

**Phase R is done** (2026-09-22). **Phase V** rebuilds the lost 30-map state (V1 ✅ → V2 ✅ → V3 Gym + Museum → V4
Diglett's Cave + Route 3 → V5 fixes), with Phase A slices in between (DECISIONS #29, #35, #55). **A5 closed** 2026-11-07 (note 87 §27). **V3 closed** 2026-11-08 (note 88 §48). **V4 closed** 2026-11-10 (note89 §21), after all four code reviews and the user's Route 3 and cave play-tests. V5's recovered fixes are next. Earlier detail is in `HISTORY.md`.

### Setup — done

| Item | State |
|---|---|
| Git | Root repo, branch `master`, **no remote**. Baseline commit `9bf2d7d` = docs + vanilla upstream. `.gitattributes`: text LF, `*.png`/`*.tilemap`/`*.gbc` binary. `game/.gitattributes` (the user's, tracked since 2026-10-14, DECISIONS #53) repeats those rules for `game/` and adds linguist hints |
| Committed generated files | `game/data/` (206 JSON) + `game/static/` (527 PNG, 3 tilemaps, 206 JSON). V4 checkpoint-01 adds `maps/DiglettsCave.json` and `maps/DiglettsCaveRoute11.json` (each mirrored) and regenerates text_programs, map_sprite_sets and battle_transitions. V3 checkpoint-04 adds `maps/Route3.json` (mirrored). Regenerate, never hand-edit |
| Ignored | `*.gbc`/`*.gb` (the ROM), `refs/`, `pkmn-sprites/`, `node_modules/`, `dist/` |
| `game/LICENSE` | **Removed by the user (2026-09-22): "i want it gone".** Deletion committed with R1c. Don't restore it (DECISIONS #28) |
| ROM | `game/pokeyellow.gbc`, SHA1 `cc7d0326…4a38e1` (DECISIONS #14) — re-verified 2026-09-22 |
| `refs/` | All 5 on pinned branches, refreshed **2026-11-03** with `./pull-refs.sh`: `pokeyellow` master `b452f2ab` (was `e89ead15`, +45: pret named every remaining symbol; ROM unchanged; **R-SYNC complete: 63-name mapping applied; historical readers adapted per note78 section6.1**), `gen1recomp` dev `d85a6176` (was `20ab97ab`, +480), `oldamber` main `268d571` (unchanged), `engine` main `1986dd93` (was `79957401`, +21: Gen 1 `calc.zig`/`chance.zig` and build), `dmg` main `5e3b785` (unchanged). `file:line` citations written before note 78 refer to `e89ead15` |
| `game/` | `gididaf/pokemon-yellow-typescript` `main` @ `05faa114` (2026-03-27), no `.git/`. Upstream `game/CLAUDE.md` folded into root `CLAUDE.md` → *Engine reference*, then deleted; moved on to `context/ARCHITECTURE.md` and the subsystem docs 2026-10-06 (DECISIONS #42) |
| `npm run setup` | 206 JSON → `data/`; static 527 PNG + 3 tilemaps + 206 JSON mirror. V4 checkpoint-03 (2026-11-09): setup twice, all 942 generated files unchanged from checkpoint-02. |
| Typecheck | Clean |
| Tests | **V4 checkpoint-04 accepted after re-review, 2026-11-10 (note89 §19).** ROM 6317/6317; no-ROM 6025 pass / 292 skip, 253 files (240 passed / 13 skipped), default workers. Bundle `index-BfVzYOru.js`, 670,982 bytes; SHA256 `2b46873bcba4170068e1d57f0a309e8cdef37f1aebe0ff105fada087896e223a`. All 942 generated files unchanged |

### What the game has today (upstream audited 2026-09-22, plus every slice since)

| Area | State |
|---|---|
| Runtime data path | ✅ **No ROM** (R1b): the browser loads only `static/` via plain `fetch()` / `<img>`. Upstream's upload gate is deleted; the bundle has no gate code |
| Vite | `publicDir: 'static'`, `base: '/'`, `appType: 'mpa'` (missing file = real 404). Tab title **PKMN** |
| Background tabs | ✅ keeps running unfocused — logic + music (worker ticker, DECISIONS #27). User-verified |
| Maps | **12 playable**: PalletTown, RedsHouse1F/2F, BluesHouse, OaksLab, Route1, Route22, ViridianCity, ViridianPokecenter, ViridianMart, ViridianSchoolHouse, ViridianNicknameHouse. **+7 playable through the debug warps since V1b:** Route2, Route2Gate, Route2TradeHouse, DiglettsCaveRoute2, ViridianForest, ViridianForestSouthGate/NorthGate, with music, palette and Pikachu. **Since V1e the walking path is open:** Viridian → Route 2 → the Forest, once the old man's demo is done. **+5 since V2a:** PewterCity, PewterPokecenter, PewterMart, PewterNidoranHouse, PewterSpeechHouse, reached from Route 2's north edge. **+3 since V3 checkpoint-01:** Museum1F, Museum2F, PewterGym (27 maps). Museum and Gym doors now reachable; the Museum ticket (checkpoint-02a) is closed; the Old Amber and the 2F hiker (checkpoint-02b) are closed; fossil pop-ups (checkpoint-02c) are closed; Brock's talk and battle (checkpoint-03b) are closed. Checkpoint-05 awards the Boulder Badge and TM34 (closed). **+1 since V3 checkpoint-04:** Route3 (28 maps), reached by the debug warp at (4,9). Pewter's east connection to Route3 is open once Brock is beaten; before that the guide still blocks the walk. Route4 stays unextracted and unnamed, so Route3's north edge is the native tree border. **V4 checkpoint-02 wires DiglettsCave and DiglettsCaveRoute11 (30 runtime-wired maps).** Dungeon2 music, CAVE palette, ladders, the gambler program, CAVERN land pairs and the failed Route11 exits are in. User-verified 2026-11-10 (note89 ?21). Route11 outdoors is not extracted. |
| Warps | ✅ since V1b: the player keeps their facing through warps, as in the ASM; Pikachu appears where Yellow's spawn states put it (`pikachu/pikachu_spawn.ts`) |
| Demo gates | ✅ **Gone since V1e**: the invented Viridian text and Route 22's fake Blue. A test fails if "demo" appears anywhere in `data/game_text.json` or `data/maps/*.json` |
| Viridian old men | ✅ **since V1e, as `scripts/ViridianCity.asm` runs them** (`story/viridian_city.ts`): the sleeping man's push-back; the forced demo after the Pokédex (fails, walk-away, Pikachu steps aside); the Mart spawning the walking old man and his repeatable demo (caught); the locked Gym door (hop down the ledge). The city's `wViridianCityCurScript` is saved (`mapScripts`), which keeps the Gym-door quirk (DECISIONS #34). User-verified |
| Route 22 | no NPCs (the rivals are I1). Its gate door leads to the unextracted `Route22Gate` and fails gracefully |
| Wild data | 57 `wild/*.json` |
| Music | **46** tracks extract; A5c3e checkpoint-02 removes the invalid `pokefluteinbattle` music entry (the real streams are unused SFX data) |
| SFX | **21** preloaded, including A5c2 CP2's RUN (bank `$08`, header `$41c5`, ID `$97`; no playback caller yet), the nurse's `healing_machine` and intro animation's preloaded `shrink`. Wired: `press_ab`, `collision`, `start_menu`, `go_inside`/`go_outside`, the two field-medicine sounds, the machine, and shrink. A5c3f checkpoint-02 adds four unused files (`damage`, `not_very_effective`, `super_effective`, `trainer_appeared`); checkpoint-05 adds unused `ball_poof` (Audio 2, `$93`). A5f checkpoint-01 adds unused `ball_toss` (Audio 2, `$91`) and `tink` (Audio 2, `$8C`). 34 SFX JSON files, 13 unused. Other SFX and bank-aware lookup → V5 |
| Type chart | **PSYCHIC bug present** — chart uses `PSYCHIC_TYPE` on both sides, species use `PSYCHIC`, so Bug→Psychic 2×, Fighting→Psychic ½×, Psychic→Psychic ½×, Ghost→Psychic 0× never apply (DECISIONS #10) → V5 |
| Hidden items | ✅ **A1b, user-verified; A5b4 timing reviewed and user-verified:** DisplayTextID opens, found program begins at T+20 before give, flag on success, longer jingle and full map close; cartridge full-bag waits. Forest Potion/Antidote and Viridian City Potion |
| Item balls | ✅ **A1b, user-verified; A5b4 timing reviewed and user-verified:** extracted `item` selects `PickUpItem`; box opens at T, give/hide T+20, found program T+23, `get_item1`, full map close after sound and A's release. Saved `hiddenObjects` keeps balls gone and tiles free. Full-bag failure keeps the ball. Route 1's sample preserves the flag-first quirk. Trade kid (A4) and Oak's Aide (A2) still await their handlers |
| Trainers | ✅ **since V1c, as `home/trainers.asm` runs them**: before-battle text → meet music (male / female / evil) → battle; on a win the fanfare after the last Pokémon, "defeated", the pic scrolling back in, "CLASS: " + end text, money; beaten only after a win (saved); after-battle text when talked to again. Oak's Lab rival: his texts, no blackout on a loss, `rivalStarter` saved. Since A5d every entry runs the shared transitions (user-verified 2026-10-18) |
| Trainer sight | ✅ **A1c, user-verified 2026-10-06** (`notes/20-a1c-plan.md`, DECISIONS #43): the Forest's map script runs `TrainerEngage` on standing passes ($fc quirk, pop-in), the meet music at spotting, EmotionBubble (61 frames), the `MoveSprite` walk-up, `wJoyIgnore`/`BIT_SEEN_BY_TRAINER`, `EndTrainerBattle`'s pass. Forest sight ranges 4, 4, 1, 0, 4. V4 checkpoint-04's midpoint trainer interruption passed review after repair (note89 §19); the busy-trainer guard and outdoor-sight tripwire are retired. |
| Catch demo | ✅ **since V1d**: Oak's Pikachu catch runs the ASM's simulated FIGHT → ITEM → POKé BALL input, with both outcomes (caught, or 3 shakes and "Shoot! It was so close too!"). Since V1e the Viridian old man uses it too |
| Whiteout | ✅ `handleBlackoutWarp` — halves money, heals, warps to last Pokécenter |
| Badge stat boosts | ✅ `battle_loaders.ts` `applyBadgeStatBoosts` (the cartridge's, on the battle copy). Brock awards the first (V3); the repeated-application bug is pinned |
| Battles | ✅ **The new engine since A5c3f 09b** (notes66–72): byte-backed turn/effects/items/AI/end; old engine deleted.10c already wired growth, starter Pikachu entrance, retreat and slide-offs. Remaining presentation: poof/OAM after the live silhouette intro (live since 04b; user play-test passed 2026-11-04), substitute/minimize/transform and other named cues; move animations stay OFF (#83; their own later slice, #94); catch screens/demo retirement stay A5f. Last user battle play-test2026-11-01; 04a changes nothing visible |
| Random numbers | ✅ **The cartridge's `Random` / `BattleRandom` everywhere** (note 74): one page-lifetime owner of `hRandomAdd` / `hRandomSub`, VBlank's per-frame call outside battle, each site's carry. No production `Math.random` (a census pins it). Battle frames skip the VBlank call (backlogged) |
| TM/HM teaching | ❌ → A2 |
| Poison walking, Repel, Escape Rope | ❌ (items exist in the price table only) → A3 |
| Text and menus | ✅ **A5a/A5b**: every overworld text, sign, hidden event, bookshelf, story scene and menu text runs the cartridge's text programs with its timing (printer, DisplayTextID open/close, PrintText); the Mart, bag, field medicine, HP bar, item/Pokécenter/Bill's PCs, START and SAVE are the cartridge's. Battle text runs on the cartridge's programs too, since A5c3f. The StatusScreen port (stats pages, shared party opening, corrected medicine timing) is user-verified |
| Evolution, move learning, Pokédex, PC, shops, save | ✅ (see `ARCHITECTURE.md` → *Engine reference* and `game/src/battle/ARCHITECTURE.md`) |
| Save | `localStorage` key `p151-s` — use **`http://127.0.0.1:5173/`** |
| Overworld pace | ✅ **since A6a (2026-09-28): the ASM's 2-frame pass.** Player and Pikachu 16 frames a step (measured 15.99), NPCs 34 (Yellow's fast codes 18, walking in step with the player 16), the mirrored up/down walking frame, the turn rule, the ledge jump table, the joypad read on standing passes, held-key triggers fixed (`overworld/walk_pace.ts`, DECISIONS #36). The user: "he walks at a perfect, gb speed". **Every cutscene, a ledge, NPC/Pikachu pace and START across a step user-verified 2026-10-01** |
| Overworld behavior | ✅ **A6b** the order inside a pass, pop-in, hiding under UI, encounter gates (2026-10-01). ✅ **A6c** NPCs wander and turn by Yellow's movement bytes with pixel sprite collisions, beaten trainers turn, Pikachu idles, glances and does its antics (2026-10-04). ✅ **A6d** the ledge shadow, the landing pass, and Pikachu on Yellow's follow-command buffer (2026-10-04). ✅ **A6e** Pikachu's scripted moves run Yellow's own interpreter — the step-aside, the nurse, Oak's Lab, the emotion preludes (2026-10-05). All user-verified |
| Sim FPS | ✅ **Game Boy rate, 59.7275 Hz** since 2026-09-25 (DECISIONS #33, `core/tick_clock.ts`), holding that rate at any display refresh. `-` / `+` step through multiples of 5 (10–200) with the Game Boy rate as a stop between 55 and 60 |

### Controls (upstream)

| Action | Keys |
|---|---|
| D-pad | Arrows or WASD |
| A / B | X / Z (swapped from upstream's Z / X at the user's request, DECISIONS #71) |
| Start / Select | Enter / Shift |
| Unlock audio | Click once on "Click to start" |
| Pause | `p` |
| Debug overlay + warps | Backtick (warps: Pallet, Viridian, Route 1, Route 22, Lab, houses, Pokécenter, Mart; since V1b also Route 2 south and north, the Forest, both Forest gates, Route 2 Gate, the trade house, the Diglett's Cave entrance, and since V4 checkpoint-02 the cave itself and the Route 11 entrance). Its **Skip Intro** button sets the intro flags and adds a Lv5 Pikachu, which is enough to test Pikachu following |
| Sim FPS | `-` / `+` (the Game Boy rate is the stop between 55 and 60) |

### Scope freezes (user)

- **1:1 vanilla Yellow.** No rebalancing, no improvements, no added content. Gen 1
  bugs reproduced deliberately.
- **Sprites are vanilla Yellow from ROM extraction** for the whole build.
  `pkmn-sprites/` stays untouched.
- **Randomizer = year-two idea** (X1, dead last, DECISIONS #21–#23). Don't start it,
  don't design around it.
- **Local only, never pushed** (DECISIONS #24). Saves on `127.0.0.1`.
- **Timeline: 1–2 years, ~700–800 sessions.** Milestones, not sittings. A session
  that delivers one small verified thing is a good session.

## In progress

**End-of-day handoff, 2026-11-10.** **V4 is complete** (note89 §21). All four code reviews passed, including the repaired checkpoint-04 (`ba535da`, review `1a8c0fe`). The user passed Route 3 (§20), then reported the cave "it all works" (§21), completing checkpoint-02's §8.7 acceptance. The user ended work for today. Dev server stopped. Tomorrow starts with V5 planning from the existing backlog; no V5 checkpoint has been briefed.

**Restart list:**
1. **Plan V5's recovered fixes.** Read the V5 row in PLAN and every V5 finding in `notes/57-findings-backlog.md`; choose and brief the first checkpoint. The order within V5 is still to be planned.
2. V4 and checkpoint-02's play-test are closed. For future play, restart from game/ with `npx vite --host 127.0.0.1 --port 5173 --strictPort`.
3. Silent battle cries are confirmed and already backlogged (note57, J2); opponent send-out is growth then cry, without the player's poof animation. Do not add an enemy ball-poof sound to compensate. The user has not assigned an audio implementation slice or changed its sequencing.

Pret's symbol file: read it into a scratch folder with `git -C refs/pokeyellow show origin/symbols:pokeyellow.sym`, from bash (PowerShell 5.1's `>` writes UTF-16), never into the repo root.

Checkpoint-04 closed: Codex's `9013024`, Claude's review passed (§22), the user's play-test "all passes" (§23, 2026-11-07).

Checkpoint-03 closed: Codex's `ccf0119`, Claude's review passed (§18), the user's play-test reported no failure (§19, 2026-11-07). Checkpoints 01–02 accepted (§12, §15).

Note75 §4 gives the later checkpoint sequence; checkpoint-03b is accepted in note77 §9. Existing growth,
Pikachu entrance, retreat and slide bodies already work (A5c3f10c); do not re-port them from stale cue prose.
**O-50 answered 2026-11-04 → DECISIONS #94:** attack move animations are a separate future slice; A5e keeps them
OFF and its sub-animation player covers only the traced presentation IDs (poof). The screen-model merge
is done (note 86 §14). Catch animations/demo retirement stay A5f; battle VBlank RNG stays backlogged.

**Current A5e workflow (decisions #95, #98, #102, #103):** planner traces and spikes one checkpoint, captures its diff,
restores the source, and briefs exact gates/stops and mutation witnesses. The named implementer applies and audits
it, verifies and commits locally; the reviewer re-runs gates and adds a mutation. **09: Claude plans/reviews, Codex
implements (#103).** Earlier checkpoint assignments are historical. Visible live changes
need the user's play-test after code review; stop at each checkpoint.

**Rules learned in A5c3f's checkpoint 11 (note 72):**
- census rows go only when the source text they record is deleted (§11.89);
- snapshots may only lose subtrees named after deleted things (§11.85);
- a `keep` case reading dead code is replaced by a new-engine test (§11.88).

**Since note 73: one 30 s suite timeout and no re-run-alone fallback.** A timeout in a full run is a real failure.

The finished A5c3f / timing / RNG detail moved to `HISTORY.md` → *Archived STATUS sections (moved 2026-11-02)*.

## Next up — queue

Claim the top one, finish it, verify, **commit locally**, log it, stop. Full roadmap in `PLAN.md`.

| # | Slice | Phase | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **V5** Recovered fixes | V | Plan checkpoints from PLAN and note57: battle-return fade, PSYCHIC chart, SFX and bank-aware lookup, species names, map objects/collisions, CGB palette-command hold. No V5 brief yet |
| — | **Attack move animations** (unscheduled) | A | Separate slice (#94), after A5e/A5f; the user places it. A **full pret `move_anim` interpreter** (#94 amended): every attack animation from the cartridge's data/routines. Needs its own plan |

After that: **the opening and title screen** (DECISIONS #69: copyright, Game Freak star, Yellow's intro movie, the title
animation and Pikachu's PCM clips; backlog entry in note 57), then **the battle-mechanics audit** (#70), then A2, A3, A4
(in-game trades, plus the player ID and the older-save question, #59), then Phase B.
Before planning any of these, search `notes/57-findings-backlog.md` for the slice id.

### Slice notes (for whoever claims them)

- **Driving the game from browser automation:** synthetic key taps shorter than
  one read are lost, because `input.ts` polls key *state*: once per tick (16.7 ms)
  in menus and text, and since A6a once per standing pass (33.5 ms) in the overworld. Hold each key ~100 ms (keydown → wait → keyup via
  `window.dispatchEvent`, `e.key` names: `x` = A, `z` = B (since DECISIONS #71; harnesses in `notes/` before 2026-10-18's swap used `z` = A), `Enter` = Start, arrows).
  Walking one step = ~160 ms held. More from V1b:
  - Start a temporary server with `npx vite --host 127.0.0.1 --port <spare>
    --strictPort`. Plain `npx vite` binds `localhost`, which is IPv6 `::1` here, so
    `127.0.0.1` URLs time out.
  - The splash needs a real click, then about a second before the title shows.
  - Debug overlay: backtick, then Skip Intro (Pikachu), then the warp dropdown + Warp.
  - The debug panel shows `Map … step x,y … dir:`, which is handy to read back with
    JS.
  - The first step after any warp skips the warp check (`justWarped`). A debug warp
    next to a door needs one step away and back.
  - A text box with `cont` lines needs one A press per scroll.
  - From V1c: a `javascript_exec` call times out after **45 s**, so keep each walk or
    button loop short. A stray A press that opens a text box makes every walk loop
    stall. The tab can turn `hidden`: rAF stops, and the debug panel stops
    rebuilding until the tab is visible again.
  - To stage a story state, edit the save in `localStorage` (`p151-s`: `mapName`,
    `playerX/Y` in px = step × 16, `eventFlags`, `party`) and CONTINUE. That's how
    V1c reached the lab rival. Use a spare port (V1c used 5179), so test saves never
    touch the user's 5173 origin, and clear them afterwards.
  - Music changes show up as `performance.getEntriesByType('resource')` entries
    under `/audio/music/`, one per track per page load.
  - From V2a CP4: arrow keys are `ArrowUp`/`ArrowDown`/…; text boxes close with **B** (A re-talks); after `NEW GAME` →
    "Skip intro? YES" the party is **empty** (the debug panel may still show a stale lead — type a species + `+ Add`); the panel
    lags about a second; the game only advances while a script runs in the page; don't press `-`/`=`; don't poll `getImageData`
    every frame. Details: `notes/60-v2-plan.md` §16.
- **Browser automation:** the game's A button is **X** and B is **Z** (DECISIONS #71, 2026-10-18; before that it was
  the other way round). Say so when handing over for a play-test.
- Notes for finished slices (R1, V1's reusable patterns, A6, A1) are in `HISTORY.md` → *Archived STATUS sections (moved
  2026-10-24)*; each slice's own plan in `notes/` has the detail.

## Open questions

- **O-53 ✅ answered 2026-11-07 → DECISIONS #106:** A. Route 3's map and Pewter's east connection become V3 checkpoint-04, before Brock's win (05).
- **O-52 ✅ answered 2026-11-06 → DECISIONS #104:** the screen-model merge runs next, before A5f.
- **O-51 ✅ answered 2026-11-04 → DECISIONS #97:** yes. The LCD-off span and the first frame after `EnableLCD` are white (Pan Docs, SameBoy's measured logic); the intro gets two dark ticks (note 79 §8.1).
- **O-50 ✅ answered 2026-11-04 → DECISIONS #94:** attack move animations get their own separate slice, not A5e.
- **O-49 ✅ answered 2026-11-02 → DECISIONS #91:** yes. The overworld RNG slice ran before A5e (note 74).
- **O-48 ✅ answered 2026-10-30 → DECISIONS #86:** option A. After a battle, an un-nicknamed mon's name goes back as
  upstream's `species.name`; 09's write-back implements it.
- **O-47 ✅ answered 2026-10-30 → DECISIONS #85:** the battle's species names come from the cartridge's `MonsterNames`, in
  checkpoint-08g before 09 (Claude briefs it next session).
- **O-46 ✅ answered 2026-11-02 → DECISIONS #90:** yes. A small separate slice for the load-sensitive timing tests runs
  after A5c3f, before A5e. It landed as note 73, and §11.16's re-run-alone rule is retired.
- **O-2: Crystal animated GIFs in the randomizer pool?** Not blocking; decide when
  X1 starts. (`DECISIONS.md` → *Open*.)

Resolved questions (O-5 … O-29; O-30 … O-38 since; O-42 … O-45 on 2026-11-02) moved to `HISTORY.md` → *Archived STATUS sections* on 2026-10-16; each
outcome is a numbered entry in `DECISIONS.md`.

## Notes for later

Findings that each have a future home moved verbatim to **`notes/57-findings-backlog.md`** on 2026-10-16.
**When you plan a slice, search that file for its id** (`V2`, `V5`, `J2`, `A5c`, `E1`, …). Most
entries point at V5 or J2; a few at A5c–A5f, V3, V4, I1 and E1. New findings go there too.

- Cable club receptionist (`ViridianPokecenter:4`): link features need a user decision; no slice is invented for it.

## Session log

### 2026-11-10 (V4 closed after cave play-test; end of day) — Codex

- After the seven cave checks, the user reported "ok, tested the cae it all works :)". Route 3 had already passed. Recorded checkpoint-02 acceptance and V4 closure in note89 §21, advancing to 8/36 milestones. Tomorrow's next work is V5 planning from note57; checkpoint order remains undecided. User ended work for today; dev server stopped. Documentation update; no tests run. Baseline remains ROM 6317/6317 and no-ROM 6025/292.

### 2026-11-10 (Route 3 user play-test passed) — Codex

- User reported "all checks pass" for the five Route 3 checks: trainer sight, direct talk/post-battle dialogue, grass encounters, ledges/Pikachu/control, and boundaries/Pewter connection. Recorded in note89 §20 and refreshed the live handoff. Cave portion of §8.7 still pending; V4 remains open. Dev server running on 127.0.0.1:5173 (HTTP 200). Documentation update; no tests run.

### 2026-11-10 (V4 checkpoint-04 repair re-reviewed, passed) — Codex

- Accepted `ba535da` after source/ASM audit and reproduced ordered gates: 942 generated hashes unchanged, bundle identical, ROM 6317/6317, no-ROM 6025/292. All five independent probes pass; thirteen mutations and independent R1/R2 fail with AssertionError and restore bytes. No runtime change required. Note89 §19. Next is the pending cave/Route3 play-test (§8.7); V4 stays open.

### 2026-11-10 (V4 checkpoint-04 repaired, awaiting re-review) — Sonnet

- Fixed Codex's two findings (note89 §17/§18). The idle interrupted hop now lands on pass 16: `preparePass` finishes the jump at `_HandleMidJump`'s `cp $10` and, with the walk counter zero, arms the landing for that same pass (the uninterrupted hop still lands on 17, a step from pass 11 on 19). `restOfPass` ends the preparation in a `finally`, so START suppressed by trainer sight no longer costs the next pass its jump tick. Three permanent regression cases added, three idle-trace expectations moved to pass 16; the reviewer's probes now pass. Setup twice: 942 files unchanged. Typecheck, build (`index-BfVzYOru.js`, 670,982 bytes), ROM 6317/6317, no-ROM 6025 / 292 skipped, marker all pass. M1–M9 (thirteen mutations) each fail with AssertionError and restore. Next: Codex re-reviews. Cave/Route 3 play-test pending; V4 open.

### 2026-11-10 (V4 checkpoint-04 reviewed, two fixes required) — Codex

- Reviewed `bc35a08`. Reproduced all ordered gates, 942 generated hashes, bundle, ROM 6314/6314 and no-ROM 6022/292, all eleven mutations and independent vector mutation R1. Four independent assertions expose two gaps: idle landing is one pass late (the original brief was wrong), and suppressed START skips the following jump tick. Note89 §17 and its probes give Sonnet the repair. Runtime restored; checkpoint-04 awaits repair and review. Checkpoint-02 play-test still pending.

### 2026-11-10 (V4 checkpoint-04 implemented, awaiting review) — Sonnet

- Implemented note89 §15: `PlayerWalk` now has the jump clock (`preparePass`, ticked before RunMapScript), the ledge's simulated presses (cursor, zero entry vs exhaustion), a landing that needs a zero walk counter, and the land-collision skip while the flag lives. A nonadjacent trainer's walk-up zeroes the pending press (`startTrainerWalkUp(…, player)`); the adjacent branch does not. `readJoypad(masked)` runs on every zero-counter pass; the busy-trainer guard and tripwire (a) are gone; warps, CONTINUE and a new game call `cancelMovement()`. 17 new no-ROM cases (`hop_trainer_interruption.test.ts`), two `hop_map_script` cases swapped. Setup twice: 942 files unchanged. Gates once each: typecheck pass, bundle `index-rQMlCRd8.js` 670,861 bytes, ROM 6314/6314 (253 files), no-ROM 6022 / 292 skipped (240 / 13), marker pass. Eleven mutations (M1–M7) each fail with AssertionError and restore. Source-backed adjustments in §16.3. Next: Codex reviews the commit. Checkpoint-02's cave and Route 3 play-test still pending; V4 stays open.

### 2026-11-10 (V4 checkpoint-04 planned for Sonnet) — Codex

- Traced the two trainer branches, zero input and exhaustion, jump and landing timing, and raw START history. Note89 §15 gives Sonnet the brief and review gates. Baseline targeted tests: 124 passed, 2 skipped. Next: Sonnet implements, Codex reviews. Checkpoint-02 play-test pending.

### 2026-11-10 (context and codebase orientation) — Codex

- Read the live V4 handoff and project references, and traced startup, overworld passes, battle sessions, scripts, saves, extraction and test setup. The checkpoint-02 cave and Route 3 play-test in note 89 §8.7 is still pending. This read-through made no game changes and ran no tests.

### 2026-11-09 (end-of-day context handoff) — Codex

- User ended the session and requested context updates. Refreshed PROJECT's stale V3 summary to the live V4 state and recorded restart instructions. Checkpoints 01–03 passed code review; checkpoint-02 cave/Route3 play-test remains incomplete, with only the silent-cry observation confirmed. Cries remain an existing deferred audio feature, not an implemented fix. Dev server stopped. No checkpoint-04 work or V4 closure. No new code/tests in this docs-only wrap-up; current baseline remains ROM 6299/6299 and no-ROM 6007/292.

### 2026-11-09 (user play-test observation: silent opponent send-outs) — Codex

- Read-only ASM/code check confirms the user's missing opponent cries: live voice.cry is a no-op, as already deferred in note57 to J2. Trainer send-out has silent growth then PlayCry in ASM; it does not use the player's ball-poof animation/sound. Logged the live confirmation and exact source owners in note57. No game change or tests needed for this source check; dev server remains running and the user's checkpoint-02 play-test is still in progress, with no acceptance inferred.

### 2026-11-09 (V4 checkpoint-03 reviewed: passed; checkpoint-02 play-test handed over) — Codex

- Reviewed `d6bc442`: exact spike bytes and independent source/geometry audit. Setup twice unchanged (942 hashes), ordered gates reproduce bundle and ROM 6299/6299 / no-ROM 6007/292; V1–V5 and independent R1/R2 caught and restored. No code/test change needed. Note89 §13 accepts checkpoint-03; checkpoint-04 not started. At the user's request, started Vite at 127.0.0.1:5173 and handed over §8.7 for checkpoint-02; no play-test result inferred. Archived oldest four log entries verbatim to HISTORY.

### 2026-11-09 (V4 checkpoint-03 implemented, awaiting review) — Grok

- Applied `03-spike.diff` on clean `1497811`. Setup twice: all 942 generated files unchanged. Gates once each: typecheck pass, bundle `index-CoPfOLj1.js` 669,049 bytes, ROM 6299/6299 (252 files), no-ROM 6007 passed / 292 skipped (239 / 13 files), marker pass. V1–V5 each an AssertionError and restored. The busy-trainer guard and Route3 proof stay. Report is note 89 §12. Next: independent review. Checkpoint-04 was not started. Checkpoint-02's user play-test is still pending.
